## Spotify Rate Limited Ingestion

A Python project designed to ingest (theoretically) all artists from the Spotify API as quickly as possible while respecting rate limits and ensuring resilience.

---

### Overview

This project showcases a **best-effort** approach to discover as many Spotify artists as possible by leveraging multiple ingestion strategies. It is built with robustness and long-running capabilities in mind, making it suitable for large-scale data collection scenarios.

---

### Key Features

- **Two Ingestion Strategies**
  1. **Search Strategy**: Uses Spotify’s `/search` endpoint. Generates a wide range of queries (letters, digits, and special characters) to systematically discover new artists.
  2. **Related Strategy (Deprecated)**: Starts from a seed list (e.g., trending artists) and iteratively explores each artist’s related artists to uncover new IDs.
     
     > **Note**: For *newly created* Spotify developer apps, the `get_related_artists` endpoint may not function as expected, making this strategy unreliable. It is therefore **deprecated** and not recommended for new apps.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - A token bucket rate limiter that adapts to Spotify’s constraints and automatically retries on `429 (Too Many Requests)` responses.

- **Resilient & Long-Running**
  - **Checkpointing**: The script persistently saves progress (`visited_ids` and `to_process`) so that it can resume after failure or interruption (e.g., keyboard interrupt).
  - **Token Refresh**: Automatically fetches and refreshes Spotify tokens when they expire or are invalid.

- **Configurable**
  - Command-line arguments allow you to:
    - Provide Spotify credentials via CLI or environment variables.
    - Choose between **search** or **related** ingestion strategies.
    - Configure rate limit (`--max-calls`, `--period`).
    - Specify output CSV file and checkpoint file paths.

- **Unit Tested**
  - Comprehensive tests for:
    - Rate Limiter (token bucket logic, blocking under load).
    - Spotify Client (auth flow, search, error handling).
    - Storage (saving artist data to CSV).
    - Auth Manager (fetches and refreshes tokens).
    - Strategies (both Search and Related).

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Installing from PyPI (Recommended)

If you’ve published this package to PyPI under the name `verse-jan25-prj`, you (or anyone else) can install it directly:

```bash
pip install verse-jan25-prj
```

Then you can run the command-line entry point:

```bash
verse-jan25-prj --help
```

This will display all the available command-line options (similar to those in the [Usage](#usage) section below).

---

#### 2. Cloning the Repository (Local Install)

Alternatively, if you’re working directly from this GitHub repo:

1. **Clone or download this repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Verse-Jan25-Prj.git
    cd Verse-Jan25-Prj
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Obtain Spotify API credentials**
    - Register or log in at [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) to create a new app.
    - Copy your Client ID and Client Secret.

4. **Set credentials (choose one)**:
    - **Option A: Environment Variables**

        ```bash
        export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
        export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
        ```

    - **Option B: Pass via CLI arguments**

        ```bash
        --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID
        --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
        ```

---

### Usage

#### Running the CLI

- **If installed via PyPI**:

    ```bash
    verse-jan25-prj [OPTIONS]
    ```

- **If running from source (the local cloned repo)**:

    ```bash
    python main.py [OPTIONS]
    ```

#### Common Arguments

- **`--client-id`**  
  Your Spotify Client ID (if not set in environment variable).

- **`--client-secret`**  
  Your Spotify Client Secret (if not set in environment variable).

- **`--strategy`**  
  - `search` (default) – uses the search queries approach.
  - `related` – explores related artists from seeds (**deprecated**, see note above).

- **`--output`**  
  Output CSV file for storing results. (Default: `artists.csv`)

- **`--checkpoint`**  
  JSON file for storing progress. (Default: `.cache/spotify_ingest_checkpoint.json`)

- **`--max-calls`**  
  Max requests per second. (Default: `1`)

- **`--period`**  
  Rolling window (in seconds) for the token bucket. (Default: `1.0`)

---

#### Example Commands

1. **Search Strategy (using environment variables)**:

    ```bash
    verse-jan25-prj --strategy search --max-calls 5 --period 1.0
    ```

    This will:
    - Use your environment variables for Spotify credentials.
    - Attempt up to 5 requests per second.
    - Search by systematically generating queries (letters, digits, `_`, `-`, `&`, space, etc.).

2. **Related Strategy (passing credentials via CLI)**:

    ```bash
    verse-jan25-prj \
        --client-id 123abc \
        --client-secret 456xyz \
        --strategy related \
        --max-calls 10 \
        --period 0.5
    ```

    > **Important**: The *related* strategy is considered **deprecated**, especially for newer Spotify developer apps that may not support fetching related artists. If you encounter errors or empty responses, switch to the **search** strategy.

If the script is interrupted, re-running the same command will resume from the checkpoint (unless you delete that file).

---

### Design & Approach

1. **Ingestion Strategies**
    - **SearchIngestionStrategy**:  
      Enumerates multiple queries (a-z, 0-9, special chars) to find new artists from Spotify’s `/search` endpoint. This helps "coax" the data from the API since Spotify does not provide a single "all artists" endpoint.
    - **RelatedArtistsIngestionStrategy (Deprecated)**:  
      Begins with a user-defined (or "trending") set of artists, then crawls each artist’s "related artists" to discover new IDs.  
      
      > **Note**: For newly registered Spotify apps, this endpoint may be restricted or unavailable, so results could be incomplete or nonexistent.

2. **Rate Limiting & Resilience**
    - **Token Bucket**:  
      Our `RateLimiter` class ensures we don’t exceed the allowed number of requests. When tokens run out, the script blocks briefly to avoid hitting the rate limit.
    - **Auto-Retry**:  
      Handles `429` responses by respecting `Retry-After` headers.
    - **Auth Refresh**:  
      If a request is `401 (Unauthorized)`, we automatically fetch a new token and retry.

3. **Checkpointing**
    - Each run saves the sets of **visited_ids** and **to_process** to a JSON file.
    - On startup, the script resumes from the last checkpoint, making it resilient against crashes, timeouts, or manual interruptions.

4. **Data Storage**
    - Default is CSV via `CSVStorage`, but you can easily replace or extend storage (e.g., database) by implementing a custom `.save_artist()` method.

5. **Testing**
    - The `tests/` folder contains unit tests for major modules (strategies, rate limiter, auth manager, storage, etc.).
    - Mocking is used extensively to avoid hitting Spotify’s real API or requiring network access during tests.

### Running Tests

From the project root, you can run:

```bash
pytest
```

It will discover and run all test files in the `tests/` directory.

---

### Notes

- This code is provided as a demonstration of architecture, rate-limiting logic, and robust data ingestion strategies.
- Real usage may require further refinements (e.g., handling additional edge cases, deeper logging, or storing more complex data).

---

### Conclusion

**Verse-Jan25-Prj** exemplifies a robust backend engineering solution for large-scale artist ingestion from Spotify. By combining:

- Token-based rate limiting,
- Multiple ingestion strategies (one of which is deprecated for new apps),
- Checkpoint-based resilience,
- And thorough testing,

…it stands ready to theoretically ingest millions of artists while adhering to Spotify’s constraints.

I know I went a little overboard, but I honestly hate the interviewing process and wanted to make a good impression.
